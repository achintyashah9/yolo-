# YOLO_Object_Detection
A comparative study of state-of-the-art object detection algorithm YOLO on the Canadian Road Dataset. This repository contains all code, configuration files, and evaluation scripts needed to reproduce training and benchmark results.

## Background
Detecting road users and infrastructure reliably is critical for autonomous driving systems. This project implements and compares three model detectors-YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10 -on the Canadian Road Dataset, which features diverse weather and lighting conditions across urban and rural road scenes.
